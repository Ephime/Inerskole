Currently the website is in two languages, Englsih and Afrikaans. All files under 'afr' directories are the Afrikaans versions. The 'en' directories are teh English versions.
In the header files the language for each page can be swtiched. A dynamic links has been placed that is decided in the app.js file under the currentPageName title.

Currentyl the biggest proble the webiste faces is making a dynamic form that exists out of 6 options:
	The first 4:
		1. (AFR) - Voorbereid
		2. (AFR) - Onvoorbereid
		3. (ENG) - Prepared
		4. (ENG) - Unprepared
These 4 are under the /entry and /en/entry directories. They generate one entry at a time. Each entry also needs to have a price of R240.00
	The last 2:
		1. (AFR) - Spanne
		2. (ENG) - Teams
These 2 are under the /team adn /en/team directories. They generate 4 entries at a time. Each entry needs to have a price of R550.00

The ideal would be if these entries can be dynamically generated adn parsed under the same directory.
What also needs to happen is that each entry needs to have a price associated that adds up and then get's paid before finally being saved to the database.
The two payment gateways (that are somewhat added already but not fully functiona) are Payfast and Yoco.
After an entry has been filled in, a review page should appear to allow the user to decide to cancel, edit or continue to payment.
When the review page is viewed, all those entries needs to be viewed on the server side so that it can be manually added if paymnet arrangements are made.
If a user cancels their payment, their entries should be moved to a cancel form/collection in the database.

The current database that's being used is mongoose, it uses a database called Candidates, with two collections:
		1. candidate
		2. teams
